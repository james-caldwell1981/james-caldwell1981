	Whether a job is good or not doesn't stop with salary or number of hours worked. Enjoying the work we do
	is important as well. So are fringe benefits like vacation, bonuses, and the topic of this article, health
	benefits.
</p>
<p>
	Benefits packages generally include an array of services and features. This allows employees access to
	healthcare when they need it at a reasonable cost. As time goes on, we are seeing more and more companies
	choose benefits	packages with mental health care explicitly included, which is a good thing. Because we
	cannot explore all benefits, lets take a look at mental health in the tech industry.
</p>
<p>
	In the following chart, we see the number of people by age who have sought assistance for a mental health issue by age.
	One detail that stands out is the percentage of people seeking help starts to increase at the mean age of 32. The second
	is that while more people did not seek help with a mental issue, the percentage of those people is very low between age 23
	and 31.

<p>
	Here is one issue with mental health in the workplace. This chart shows the number of people reporting a negative consequence
	as a direct result of their mental health issue being made public knowledge. It is evident this is less prominent in very small
	companies with fewer than 6 employees and companies with 100 to 1000 employees. The percentage of employees seeking help
	despite the possible negative consequences is highest in companies with 26 to 500 employees and those with over 1000.

<p>
	This last chart shows employee overall sentiment toward the company versus if those employees feel anonymity is respected.
	As the sentiment score increases, so does the percentage of employees who feel there health concerncs will be kept anonymous.
	There is also a correlation between higher sentiment scores and employees who are willing to seek assistance with their mental
	health issues.

<p>
	In closing, mental health in decades past has been a taboo topic for many with many stigma attached to those brave enough
	to admit they need assistance. Using information directly from the employees of a company, it is possible for a company
	to detect issues within itself to better facilitate the correction of a perceived issue by the employee. This also enables
	a company to best choose benefits packages for their employees so there are not as many options which go unused, thus wasting
	both company and employee assets. When employees are able to seek assistance and use more of what they pay for, it contributes
	to a better sentiment toward the company which lends itself to longevity of staff and higher profits for everyone involved.
