	<h1>Data Exploration and Visualization</h1>
	<p>Speed Dating Experiment by Columbia Business School</p>
</div>

<p>
	Columbia Business School conducted a speed dating experiment from 2002 to 2004. The two Professors,
	Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar, were interested in gender differences in mate selection. You can read
	their paper <a href="https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/emir.kamenica/documents/genderDifferences.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The experiment consisted of groups of males and females aged 18 to 55. Each event conducted was called a wave.
	This made controlling the variables, such as the rating system, for further analysis on how each group of
	participants operated within the constraints of the experiment.
</p>

<p>
	Each participant went on 4 minute 'first dates' with every other person of the opposite gender.
	The participants were asked to rate their dates according to metrics set forth by the school.
	Below are two scatter plots of both the couples who matched, chose to exchange contact information,
	and unmatched couples who did not wish for future contact outside of the event. These plots are exploratory only.
</p>

	<figcaption>These are the interests of men and women who matched with someone.</figcaption>
</div>

<div class="plot_wrapper">
	<img src="C:\Users\bandm\Documents\GitHub\james-caldwell1981\projects\build1\unmatched.png" class="plot">
	<figcaption>These are the interests of men and women who did not match with anyone.</figcaption>
</div>

<p>
	Upon first glance, we see there are some distinct differences in those who matched and those who did not.
	Given this, we will explore some of the seemingly more influential factors in whether two people match during
	their 4 minute first date.
</p>

<p>
	Below is a line chart of matches versus age difference. It is very apparent that these two attributes
	show strong correlation. This means the participants are more likely matched when the age difference is higher.
	What is not apparent are the underlying factors driving this correlation.
</p>

	<figcaption>As can be seen above, there is a direct correlation between matching and age difference.</figcaption>
</div>

<p>
	As we explore further, it becomes apparent that couples participating in the experiment are more likely to match
	if the male is older and the female is younger. But how much older? As it turns out, the males need to be approximately
	3.6 years older than their paired female in order to maximize the chances for them to choose to match with each other.

	<figcaption>Couples are more likely to match if the males are older than the paired females.</figcaption>
</div>

<p>
	This experiment exampled many differences in each gender when choosing a romantic partner. It also showed many of the 
	underlying factors driving those decisions, most of which we could not explore in depth here. Age is more of an
	influencing factor than what could be discerned at first glance. Next time we'll go more in depth to explore more
	of the underlying influences for more insight into how they cause one decision over another in either or both genders.
